# 16F84midi
Midi drum trigger for PIC 16F84

Debounce input pins and when low send midi note-on information, when back high again send note-off.

I wish I could remember the hardware needed to get from the output pins to something that can go into a midi input - probably just a series resitor.

For reference, this is the datasheet for the chip: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/35007b.pdf
